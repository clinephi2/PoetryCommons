		The landscape (the landscape!) again: Gloucester,<br>

		(from offshore, I, Maximus) am removed, observe.<br>
 		<br>
		In this night I moved on the territory with combinations<br>
		(new mixtures) of old and known personages: the leader,<br>
		my father, in an old guise, here selling books and manuscripts.<br>
 		<br>
		My thought was, as I looked in the window of his shop,<br>
		there should be materials here for Maximus, when, then,<br>
		I saw he was the young musician has been there (been before me)<br>
 		<br>
		before. It turned out it wasn’t a shop, it was a loft (wharf-<br>
		house) in which, as he walked me around, a year ago<br>
		came back (I had been there before, with my wife and son,<br>
 		<br>
		I didn’t remember, he presented me insinuations via<br>
		himself and his girl) both of whom I had known for years.<br>
		But never in Gloucester. I had moved them in, to my country.<br>
 		<br>
		His previous appearance had been in my parents’ bedroom where I<br>
		found him intimate with my former wife: this boy<br>
		was now the Librarian of Gloucester, Massachusetts!<br>

		hadn’t even connected her with my being there, that she was<br>
 		<br>
		here. That she was there (in the Promised Land—the Cut!<br>
		But there was this business, of poets, that all my Jews<br>
		were in the fish-house too, that the Librarian had made a party<br>
 		<br>
		I was to read. They were. There were many of them, slumped<br>
		around. It was not for me. I was outside. It was the Fort.<br>
		The Fort was in East Gloucester—old Gorton’s Wharf, where the Library<br>
 		<br>
		was. It was a region of coal houses, bins. In one a gang<br>
		was beating someone to death, in a corner of the labyrinth<br>
		of fences. I could see their arms and shoulders whacking<br>
 		<br>
		down. But not the victim. I got out of there. But cops<br>
		tailed me along the Fort beach toward the Tavern<br>

		The sea is calm tonight.<br>
		The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br>
		Upon the straits; on the French coast the light<br>
		Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,<br>
		Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.<br>
		Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br>
		Only, from the long line of spray<br>
		Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,<br>
		Listen! you hear the grating roar<br>
		Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br>
		At their return, up the high strand,<br>
		Begin, and cease, and then again begin,<br>
		With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br>
		The eternal note of sadness in.<br>
		<br>
		Sophocles long ago<br>
		Heard it on the Ægean, and it brought<br>
		Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br>
		Of human misery; we<br>
		Find also in the sound a thought,<br>
		Hearing it by this distant northern sea.<br>
		<br>
		The Sea of Faith<br>
		Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore<br>
		Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br>
		But now I only hear<br>
		Its melancholy, long withdrawing roar<br>
		Retreating to the breath<br>
		Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br>
		And naked shingles of the world. <br>
		<br>
		Ah love, let us be true to one another!<br>
		For the world, which seems<br>
		To lie before us like a land of dreams<br>
		So various, so beautiful, so new<br>
		Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor lighter<br>
		Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain<br>
		And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>
		Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight<br>
		Where ignorant armies clash by night<br>
