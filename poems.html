		<p>
		The sea is calm tonight.<br>
		The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br>
		Upon the straits; on the French coast the light<br>
		Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,<br>
		Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.<br>
		Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br>
		Only, from the long line of spray<br>
		Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,<br>
		Listen! you hear the grating roar<br>
		Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br>
		At their return, up the high strand,<br>
		Begin, and cease, and then again begin,<br>
		With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br>
		The eternal note of sadness in.<br>
		<br>
		Sophocles long ago<br>
		Heard it on the Ã†gean, and it brought<br>
		Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br>
		Of human misery; we<br>
		Find also in the sound a thought,<br>
		Hearing it by this distant northern sea.<br>
		<br>
		The Sea of Faith<br>
		Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore<br>
		Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br>
		But now I only hear<br>
		Its melancholy, long withdrawing roar<br>
		Retreating to the breath<br>
		Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br>
		And naked shingles of the world. <br>
		<br>
		Ah love, let us be true to one another!<br>
		For the world, which seems<br>
		To lie before us like a land of dreams<br>
		So various, so beautiful, so new<br>
		Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor lighter<br>
		Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain<br>
		And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>
		Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight<br>
		Where ignorant armies clash by night<br>
